### Dmitrii Zakharov
Columbia University Engineering BSCS '23 & MSCS 24

Hello there! I am a Machine Learning Master's student at Columbia University graduating in December 2024. I hold a BS CS degree from there as well. My passion is integrating cutting edge AI/ML solutions with various systems to achieve previously unattainable levels of automation, and I'm currently researching ways to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. I'm proficient in Python with a lot of experience in C/C++, Java, and SQL.
I also participated in some competitive programming events as a member of one of the Columbia ICPC teams.

You can find the links to my up-to-date resume and LinkedIn on [my website](https://dmitrii.tech).

**Fun fact:** my bucket list includes competing in a chessboxing event!
